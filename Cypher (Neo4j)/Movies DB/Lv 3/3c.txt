//c) The "Purest" Actors: Find actors who have ONLY acted. Assume that the database relationships may fluxuate, so you cannot simply use "Not Directed" logic. Order by the number of movies they have acted in, most to least
match (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
  with a, count(*) as actings,  COUNT{(a)-[]->()} as totalRelations
  where actings = totalRelations
  order by actings desc
return a.name, actings,totalRelations
